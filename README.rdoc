== README

This is the demo app for the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (for {Rails 4.0}[http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages?version=4.0]). It's a microposts blog generated with scaffolding. However, I have added some (very simple) changes:

* static home page and routing to it

* microposts listed on user show page

* viewing created_at field

* a few links between views

The app should be running on heroku:
